## emp_tcpi ##


EMP TCP/IP Interface extension. This repository is automatically pulled in as a dependency.


### Dev Notes ###

Make sure when compiling, set the environment variable EMP_ROOT equal to the
path to the primary emp repo clone on the local machine. This is so EMPDB can
reference the lib/ directory for include files.
